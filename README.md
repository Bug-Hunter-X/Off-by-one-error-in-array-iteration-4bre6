This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java that frequently leads to `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The `Bug.java` file contains code with the error. The solution is presented in `BugSolution.java`.  The error is subtle and often missed, especially in complex loops. This example emphasizes the importance of carefully checking loop conditions to avoid common indexing errors.
